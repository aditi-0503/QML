# QML
 In this project, we explore the application of Quantum Machine Learning (QML)techniques for breast cancer prediction, employing the
 Qiskit framework and classical machine learning methods.
 Through systematic data pre-processing, quantum circuit construction, and model training, we demonstrated the feasibility and
 effectiveness of quantum-assisted approaches in healthcare diagnostics.
 Our findings revealed promising results, with the Quantum Variational Classifier (VQC) achieving high accuracy in predicting breast
 cancer outcomes on both training and testing datasets
